=================

This is yet another brainfuck interpreter. There is nothing
particularly special about this implementation. It was birthed by a
night of wandering around the esolangs wiki and wanting a Haskell
project to write after not writing anything in years.

Example programs are from the esolangs wiki: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck
